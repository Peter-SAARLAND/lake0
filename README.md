# Restic Backup Docker Container
A docker container to automate [restic backups](https://restic.github.io/)

This container runs restic backups in regular intervals. 

* Easy setup and maintanance
* Support for different targets (tested with: Local, NFS, SFTP, AWS)
* Support `restic mount` inside the container to browse the backup files

**Container**: [lobaro/restic-backup-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/lobaro/restic-backup-docker/)

Stable
```
docker pull lobaro/restic-backup-docker:1.2-0.9.4
```

Latest (experimental)
```
docker pull lobaro/restic-backup-docker:latest
```

Please don't hesitate to report any issue you find. **Thanks.**

# Test the container

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Lobaro/restic-backup-docker.git
cd restic-backup-docker
```

Build the container. The container is named `backup-test`
```
./build.sh
```

Run the container.
```
./run.sh
```

This will run the container `backup-test` with the name  `backup-test`. Existing containers with that names are completly removed automatically.

The container will backup `~/test-data` to a repository with password `test` at `~/test-repo` every minute. The repository is initialized automatically by the container.

To enter your container execute

```
docker exec -ti backup-test /bin/sh
```

Now you can use restic [as documented](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), e.g. try to run `restic snapshots` to list all your snapshots.

## Logfiles
Logfiles are inside the container. If needed you can create volumes for them.

```
docker logs
```
Shows `/var/log/cron.log`

Additionally you can see the the full log, including restic output, of the last execution in `/var/log/backup-last.log`. When the backup fails the log is copied to `/var/log/restic-error-last.log`. If configured, you can find the full output of the mail notification in `/var/log/mail-last.log`.

# Customize the Container

The container is setup by setting [environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#/env-environment-variables) and [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems).

## Environment variables

* `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` - the location of the restic repository. Default `/mnt/restic`. For S3: `s3:https://s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET_NAME`
* `RESTIC_PASSWORD` - the password for the restic repository. Will also be used for restic init during first start when the repository is not initialized.
* `RESTIC_TAG` - Optional. To tag the images created by the container.
* `NFS_TARGET` - Optional. If set the given NFS is mounted, i.e. `mount -o nolock -v ${NFS_TARGET} /mnt/restic`. `RESTIC_REPOSITORY` must remain it's default value!
* `BACKUP_CRON` - A cron expression to run the backup. Note: cron daemon uses UTC time zone. Default: `0 */6 * * *` aka every 6 hours.
* `RESTIC_FORGET_ARGS` - Optional. Only if specified `restic forget` is run with the given arguments after each backup. Example value: `-e "RESTIC_FORGET_ARGS=--prune --keep-last 10 --keep-hourly 24 --keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 52 --keep-monthly 120 --keep-yearly 100"`
* `RESTIC_JOB_ARGS` - Optional. Allows to specify extra arguments to the back up job such as limiting bandwith with `--limit-upload` or excluding file masks with `--exclude`.
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Optional. When using restic with AWS S3 storage.
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Optional. When using restic with AWS S3 storage.
* `MAILX_ARGS` - Optional. If specified, the content of `/var/log/backup-last.log` is sent via mail after each backup using an *external SMTP*. To have maximum flexibility, you have to specify the mail/smtp parameters by your own. Have a look at the [mailx manpage](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mailx) for further information. Example value: `-e "MAILX_ARGS=-r 'from@example.de' -s 'Result of the last restic backup run' -S smtp='smtp.example.com:587' -S smtp-use-starttls -S smtp-auth=login -S smtp-auth-user='username' -S smtp-auth-password='password' 'to@example.com'"`.

## Volumes

* `/data` - This is the data that gets backed up. Just [mount](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#volume-shared-filesystems) it to wherever you want.

## Set the hostname

Since restic saves the hostname with each snapshot and the hostname of a docker container is derived from it's id you might want to customize this by setting the hostname of the container to another value.

Set `--hostname` in the [network settings](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings)

## Backup via SFTP

Since restic needs a **password less login** to the SFTP server make sure you can do `sftp user@host` from inside the container. If you can do so from your host system, the easiest way is to just mount your `.ssh` folder conaining the authorized cert into the container by specifying `-v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh` as argument for `docker run`.

Now you can simply specify the restic repository to be an [SFTP repository](https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Manual/#create-an-sftp-repository).

```
-e "RESTIC_REPOSITORY=sftp:user@host:/tmp/backup"
```

## Backup via rclone

To use rclone as a backend for restic, simply add the rclone config file as a volume with `-v /absolute/path/to/rclone.conf:/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`.

# Versioning & Changelog
